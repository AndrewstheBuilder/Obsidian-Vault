1. I do not want to start with arguments against the source material in the bible. That is too irrelevant to us. Even if anyone will claim its the most relevant thing to them and what they base their lives on. Actually want to start with **WHY** you believe in what you believe in. What drives you to this belief.
	- This is intended for discussion with Nahshon but it will probably apply to most of my christian friends.
2. I can refer to the source material of the bible and the Case for Christ - by Lee Strobel.
	- The early writing style is different they did not stress biographies or think that the early lives of people had anything to do with their later lives. They were writing to spread an ideology as all ancient writers were. So they spend some 3 paragraphs on Jesus's birth then focus the rest of their efforts on his teachings and his miracles. With all of this culminating in his death and resurrection so tell me why are the accounts of his resurrection different. Why does Mark's or John's account pull primarily from Psalms showing Jesus's death as a fulfillment of a prophecy for Psalms verses when in reality those Psalms had nothing to do with Jesus. They were intended for some other purpose. The most important moments did not have much original source material so the writer of the Gospel of Mark or John had to scramble for such sources.
