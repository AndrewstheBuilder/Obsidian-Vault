	- realized something about my [[Emotional Incest]] experience and my [[Struggle With Dating]]. My feelings were not being heard so I shut them off. But my basic needs were met so I never realized that my feelings were not being heard. Until today.
	- [[What Caused the Trauma Epiphany]]: it was the result of me confronting my mother over text about the damage that was done and is currently being done by her towards Austin and me to a lesser degree. That caused some emotions to come up as she became more defensive and not acknowledging what she was doing. This would come up in highly emotional moments where she would invalidate my experience with her own. "I worked so hard to get you here but you are so ungrateful". It was the similarity of that experience and I realized I wanted to block my own emotions and starve myself because 1. I realized I could not win this fight. And 2. I wanted to get back at her by destroying myself. To show her look what you have done to me.
