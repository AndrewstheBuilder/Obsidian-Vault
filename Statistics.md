* What is variance, covariance, standard deviation? Give intuitions for the purpose of their existence and usage.
* Why do we have to square the differences for the variance calculation?
  - Example a. $\frac{|4| + |4| + |−4| + |−4|}{4} = \frac{4 + 4 + 4 + 4}{4} = 4$
  - Example b. $\frac{|7| + |1| + |−6| + |−2|}{4} = \frac{7 + 1 + 6 + 2}{4} = 4$
  see how both of those are the same value even though the bottom example has higher changes. So what has to happen is that we have to square the differences between the (value - mean) to exaggerate larger differences over smaller ones. And that will give us a higher variance for the bottom example vs. the top one.
	- Example a. $\frac{4^2 + 4^2 + 4^2 + 4^2}{4} = 16$
	- Example b. $\frac{7^2 + 1^2 + 6^2 + 2^2}{4} = 47.5$
- [[Deep Work Machine Learning Exploration]] 07/11/24: Learn statistics relevant to machine learning to give myself a deeper understanding of machine learning. But will this be where most of my effort should be put. Into understanding statistics so that I can do better machine learning work. I think this information is best used in understanding the data I am working with. So that I can know what kind of results are possible and not possible.
	- I would rather learn this on a need to know basis. There is just too much to front load. At least to learn it all in one day.
