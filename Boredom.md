- I have been exploring why I get bored. There does not seem to be any good books or anything related to this. 
- I think I get bored when things I am learning stop being relevant to me. Or its too difficult to understand. Or its too easy for me.
	- So find items at the right level of difficulty and find things that are relevant to myself.
