#### Places I am looking at:
- Tampa Florida because Logan is moving here and I loved it.
- Austin, Texas because its like Tampa Florida/St Petes (probably one of my favorite places ever) And the tech scene and jiu jitsu scene there is top notch.
- Everywhere else is for tech scene first and jiu jitsu scene second. Except Maryland
- San Diego, California
- San Francisco, California. Silicon valley baby!
	- Visiting San Francisco this December! [[Visiting San Francisco December 2024]]
- Chicago
- Seattle
- Maryland. Standard Jiu Jitsu!!!
	- Washington DC!!
- Atlanta
	- I like the area. Traffic seems insane. But its very pretty. Mountainous. Lot of baddies. LOL. 
- Boston, MA
- Boulder, CO
	- Popped as highest paid in [https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes150000.htm]
	- I can live in the surrounding cities since Boulder is a small place.
	- Might be too small for me though for socializing
- Denver, CO
- Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina
- Portland, Oregon
- Salt Lake City, Utah
- Miami, Florida

#### Evaluating Places
- I do not feel like I evaluated college well enough so I want to evaluate places to move to in better ways. Reddit tells me what to look at. But I need to confirm this with cold hard data. Where can I get cold hard data for jobs, dating/social scene, and jiu jitsu.
