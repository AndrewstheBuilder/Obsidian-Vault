#### Places I am looking at:
- Tampa Florida because Logan is moving here and I loved it.
- Austin, Texas because its like Tampa Florida/St Petes (probably one of my favorite places ever) And the tech scene and jiu jitsu scene there is top notch.
- Everywhere else is for tech scene first and jiu jitsu scene second. Except Maryland
- San Diego, California
- San Francisco, California. Silicon valley baby!
- Chicago
- Seattle
- Maryland. Standard Jiu Jitsu!!!
	- Washington DC!!
- Atlanta
- Boston, MA

#### Evaluating Places
- I do not feel like I evaluated college well enough so I want to evaluate places to move to in better ways. Reddit tells me what to look at. But I need to confirm this with cold hard data. Where can I get cold hard data for jobs, dating/social scene, and jiu jitsu.
