* 07/16/24: How am I suppose to help with this? It seems like the internet and Logan is saying that she should have gotten a lawyer. I personally think that might have been a better idea because she does not seem to want to help her self that badly. She might be on her way to self-sabotage. I do not know how to help her. I feel bad for her. She is all alone in this fight. The more I try to help her though the angrier I feel. But this is important shouldn't I put aside my feelings and try my best? [[Emotional Incest]] may be a way to get back at my mother for the trauma she caused me by doing the same thing to her. Ignoring her needs. But this school of thought says that fundamentally I am not supposed to be taking care of her and her needs. And I think I am starting to agree. My life is hard as it is. And I feel worried about Austin. 
	* I mean she has done so much damage to us. Constantly berating Austin. "This dumbass can't do anything right. Pottan pooran ayy pooilo" Making him cry like this when we were younger. I feel so angry and sad right now. 
	* Of course she might not have meant to hurt us but she seems emotionally immature. Constantly telling me about the house problems. Not being able to pay the bills
	* Constantly making me feel obligated to her for how hard she worked to get me to America. And how hard she has to work everyday to support us. 
	* Fuck you!
* I am not trying to hurt her. I will give her the help that is reasonably within my means. I will obviously help Austin as much as I can without taking the co-parenting role with my mother because that is disgusting!

	* Post trial. I feel like my mother is a emotionally immature person. She did not realize that the court is not going to consider her subjective emotions to consider the case. The case is fought on matters of the law. I can not have a real opinion on this because I was not there but this is what I think. She wanted 3 days to go over what. When we were in there it felt like she was dragging it out. It was painful to be there. I felt like she was so incompetent. I felt sorry for her as I usually do. I do not think I understand her reasoning. Her model of the world and the way she reasons has finally failed her. And honestly she deserves it. Look at what she has put us through all of these years. Being emotionally immature led to her not considering the damage she was doing to us by staying in this horrible marriage for so long. Even after the experience of her first marriage. Because she thought since he was not physically harming us constantly that it was going to be fine.
	* The judge did not want narrative witness statements. Because the judge could tell that my mom was going to drag it out. My mom does not have enough self-awareness to figure out what she is doing.
	* I have lost all feelings for her. I felt like I lost it a long time ago. 
	* I am only looking for physical healing. From this fatigue. From my eye sight issues. From my sexual repression. Mom can take care of herself and Austin can too. While they may need my advice I am not responsible for their well beings.
