* 07/16/24: How am I suppose to help with this? It seems like the internet and Logan is saying that she should have gotten a lawyer. I personally think that might have been a better idea because she does not seem to want to help her self that badly. She might be on her way to self-sabotage. I do not know how to help her. I feel bad for her. She is all alone in this fight. The more I try to help her though the angrier I feel. But this is important shouldn't I put aside my feelings and try my best? [[Emotional Incest]] may be a way to get back at my mother for the trauma she caused me by doing the same thing to her. Ignoring her needs. But this school of thought says that fundamentally I am not supposed to be taking care of her and her needs. And I think I am starting to agree. My life is hard as it is. And I feel worried about Austin. 
	* I mean she has done so much damage to us. Constantly berating Austin. "This dumbass can't do anything right. Pottan pooran ayy pooilo" Making him cry like this when we were younger. I feel so angry and sad right now. 
	* Of course she might not have meant to hurt us but she seems emotionally immature. Constantly telling me about the house problems. Not being able to pay the bills
	* Constantly making me feel obligated to her for how hard she worked to get me to America. And how hard she has to work everyday to support us. 
	* Fuck you!
* I am not trying to hurt her. I will give her the help that is reasonably within my means. I will obviously help Austin as much as I can without taking the co-parenting role with my mother because that is disgusting!
